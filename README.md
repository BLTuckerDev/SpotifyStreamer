# SpotifyStreamer

My SpotifyStreamer for the Udacity Android Nano Degree. This was the first project
assigned to me during my Android Nano Degree program. We were given a spotify SDK
and instructions to make an app that would allow a user to search for artists and
play sample tracks by those artists.
